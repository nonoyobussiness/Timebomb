# ⏳ Timebomb – Time-Locked Social Content  

**Timebomb** is a new kind of social platform where content isn’t instant—it’s locked behind time.  
You drop a **timebomb post** and set when it explodes: minutes, hours, days… or even years later. Until then, everyone waits. Curiosity builds. Anticipation grows.
